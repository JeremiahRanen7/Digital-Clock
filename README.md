# Digital Clock

A simple digital clock implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project showcases a digital clock that displays the current time and updates in real-time. It's a minimalistic and stylish clock with a pleasant background color.

## Getting Started

To view the digital clock, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The clock will be displayed on the page.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Styling

The clock is styled using the "Poppins" and "Mooli" fonts, giving it a modern and clean appearance. The background color and box shadow enhance the visual appeal.

## How it Works

The JavaScript script (`script.js`) retrieves the current time and formats it into hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM. It then updates the content of the HTML container element with the formatted time.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the styling and appearance of the clock by modifying the `style.css` file. You can change the fonts, colors, and other styles according to your preferences.
